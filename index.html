        Eighteen years have passed since I lost the ability to ease into a learning flow-state. The purpose of this webpage is to combine the software engineering learning process with providing various mental/consciosness improvement concepts which have been found by more intelligent humans than I. Questions revolving around the importance of the human experience and the differences between the journey and the destination shall be documented. I will not psychoanalyze my own renderings as the process of research and dictation will be slowed.</p>

        <h1>Stream of Consciousness</h1>
        <p>The possibility of one's consciousness breeching the walls of material confinement. What would it take for an individual to stretch his mind from his body? <br> I believe this concept is called "astral projection". Is this the same concept though? Is the astral realm the same as the material? Or is there a veil which separates material, etherial, astral. <br> What are the differences? If one's consciousness can be aware of the material world at distances far from his/her grounding point (aka:his/her body) then are the realms all connected, vibrating at slightly differing frequencies? <br> Also, how do any of these blithering questions deal with <em>Mastering the Mind</em>?</p>
