        <em>Becoming the change self wishes to see.</em> <br><br> The purpose of this webpage is to combine the software engineering learning process with providing various mental/consciosness improvement concepts which have been found by more intelligent humans than I. Questions revolving around the importance of the human experience and the differences between the journey and the destination shall be documented.<br><br>Is laying out a purpose important to the functionality of what is being created?<br><br> What is this experience of life meant to achieve? </p>

        <h1>Stream of Consciousness</h1>
        <p>The possibility of one's consciousness breeching the walls of material confinement. What would it take for an individual to stretch his mind from his body? <br> I believe this concept is called "astral projection". Is this the same concept though? Is the astral realm the same as the material? Or is there a veil which separates material, etherial, astral. <br> What are the differences? If one's consciousness can be aware of the material world at distances far from his/her grounding point (aka:his/her body) then are the realms all connected, vibrating at slightly differing frequencies? <br> What I was looking for was <b>remote viewing</b>.<br> Also, how do any of these blithering questions deal with <em>Mastering the Mind</em>?</p>

      <h3>Hermeticism</h3>
      <p>This philosophy claims seven fundamental rules for the understanding of reality.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mentalism</li>
          <p>The ALL is Mind; the Universe is Mental</p>
        <li>Correspondence</li>
          <p>As above, so below; as below, so above</p>
        <li>Vibration</li>
          <p>Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates</p>
        <li>Polarity</li>
          <p>Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled</p>
        <li>Rhythm</li>
          <p>Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates</p>
        <li>Cause and Effect</li>
          <p>Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law</p>
        <li>Gender</li>
          <p>Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes</p>
      </ol>
